**[[Run Online]](https://codecentral.devexpress.com/t479780/)**

This exampleÂ illustratesÂ a server-side technique of editing hierarchicalÂ custom appointment fieldsÂ using cascading MVC ComboBoxes.<br>The main idea of implementing cascading MCX ComboBoxes was demonstrated in the following examples:<br><a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/T155879">GridView - A simple implementation of cascading comboboxes in Batch Edit mode</a><br><a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E2844">MVC ComboBox Extension - Cascading Combo Boxes</a><br>In this example, we added twoÂ custom fields for appointments (<strong>CompanyID</strong>Â andÂ <strong>ContactID</strong>)<strong>Â </strong>and two corresponding MVC ComboBoxes onto a customÂ Appointment Edit form.Â <br>An approach for customizing the Appointment Edit Form for working with custom fields was described here:<br><a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/T156298">How to create a custom Appointment form to work with custom fields (based on T153478)</a><br>Changing a value of the "<strong>CompanyID</strong>" combobox results in filtering data in the "<strong>ContactID</strong>" combobox.
